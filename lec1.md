# What is Philosophy?

## Personal Philosophy:

Optimist might *always look on the bright side*

Whereas a stocktrader's philosophy might be *buy low, sell high*

## Lifestyle Choice

*Hakuna Matata*, there are no worries
*Have a good time... all the time*, Spinal Tap

## Why are Philosophical Questions Tough?

They're General: They are very general and abstract and about general principles rather than local matters of fact.

They're Tough:

* If everything that happens is necessitated by prior causes, then is human freedom possible?

* If human actions aren't free, how can we hold people morally responsible for their actions?

General principles (theories) and specific applications:

Philosophers look to understand general principles, in part, because of their implications in specific cases.

General principles can guide us in our reasoning about specifics.

ex. Is it fair that I be forced to pay for other people's healthcare?

## Plato's Cave

The average person is shackled to a limited theater, but Plato wants to unchain himself from the seat in the cave where all you see are shadows on a screen. He thinks most people only see shadow images of what the world is, and that there are things going on behind the scenes.

Free from the shackles, we can climb out of the cave and see the forms, the people making the shadows and holding up the puppets.

He is suggesting that this ascent from the chained seats to the reality above is our way to ascend and see the general principles, the source of these things that lets you understand the situations down in the cave.

Philosophers want to tear themselves away from the knee jerk, normal questions, and find the higher principles that explain life.

He's being elitist, saying that philosophers are more important and have a clearer picture than normal people watching the shadows.

**Ethics**: deals with questions of how we ought to live and act, and about the kind of people we should strive to be.

Not necessarily with how we do live and act, but how we ought to and the kind of people we ought to be.

The **ought** reflects a concern with value. Which kinds of actions are good/right and which kinds are bad/wrong?

## Kinds of Values

**Personal Values**: What's valuable to you, but not necessarily valuable to others.

**Instrumental Values**: Some things are valuable as means to an end, like a hammer is valuable if you need to nail something in.

This course is instrumentally valuable if I want to graduate, because I need a credit. This course only has value while I need to get the credit, after that, it is not valuable.

**Cultural Values**: Different cultures embody different customs and traditions. These are often closely tied to the culture's sense of its own identity and worth.

Value, as it pertains to ethics, is different from personal, instrumental and cultural value.

**Moral Values**: A moral value is universal and objective. They are not a matter of subjective preference, unlike personal value.

They are not solely concerned with means to an end, unlike instrumental value.

Not simply a matter of cultural traditions and identity, the fact that a certain culture adopts a set of customs that those customs are legitimate and valuable.

You can invoke ethical values to actually critique cultural values. These moral/ethical values are broader, more general than all the other types.

Ex.

Torturing small animals, merely for the sake of amusement is wrong.

This statement's truth is not dependent on your personal preferences, instrumental preferences, or cultural preferences.

Moral values are not subjective preferences, they are claims that are broader and transcend other sorts of expressions of value.

The notion of universal values is puzzling in Aristotle's sense. It is not clear what universal values are based on.

It is not an easy question to answer. It isn't clear how we evaluate their application to particular issues.

There is no one source of truth for what universal values should be. The fact that there is dispute does not mean that the questions cannot be answered.

Philosophy begins in wonder.
