* Normative Ethics
* Applied Ethics
* Meta-Ethics

## Method in Philosophy

* Argumentation
* Argument Analysis
* Argument Evaluation

## Normative Ethics

Central Questions:

* How do we evaluate the morality of our actions and the actions of others?
* What principles lie behind answering this question?

## Applied Ethics

A sub-branch of normative ethics, it deals specifically with the application of normative principles to concrete moral issues. Deals with controversial issues with difficult solutions.

## Meta-Ethics

The very meaning and nature of ethics. Branch that deals with the meaning and significance of ethical concepts.

What does it mean for someone's actions to be wrong, or that some other action is a good thing to do. What do these ethical concepts really mean?

Meta level ethics.

> Meta ethics does not try to answer either particular or general questions about what is good, right or obligatory. It asks and tries to answer...questions like the following: What is the meaning or use of the expressions "morally right" or "good"? How can ethical value judgments be established or justified? Can they be justified at all? - Frankena

What are we doing when we engage in questions of right and wrong? What kind of justification can we give if any for the answers to these questions?

## Argumentation

Making arguments, designing arguments, criticizing other people's positions are at the core of philosophical activity.

Socrates agreement upon death:

Premise 1: One should not break one's agreements.
Premise 2: Escaping punishment would involve breaking an agreement.

There is a sub-argument for premise 2:

1. If one remains in a state when one could leave it, then one tacitly agrees to obey one's laws.

2. Socrates has stayed, even though he could have left.

Conclusion: Therefore, escaping punishment would involve breaking an agreement.

## Argument Analysis

Identifying the premises, conclusions of a work. Identify the ways that the premises are meant to provide support to the conclusion.
